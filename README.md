# KMeans Clustering - Client segmentation
I wanted to do some project about clustering and take a more in depth view of those kind of algorithms. Ended up reinforcing my Pandas knowledge too :)

---

My idea with this project is looking in depth on the KMeans Clustering algorithm. I found in Kaggle (as always) a dataset with some information about characteristics of different clients. My idea is to be able to create a model that can segment the clients to know which ones are willing to be converted into costumers.
I'll be using SKlearn & Pandas.
